# Playwright Critical Paths (T-40.1)

1. Anonymous browse → product detail → add to cart → checkout (mock mode)  
   - Steps: home → products → select product → add to cart → open cart → go to checkout → verify guest prompt.
2. Logged-in checkout with Stripe  
   - Auth via Supabase → fill shipping/method → start Stripe session → simulate success → confirm order.
3. Admin login + order status update  
   - Admin user signs in → `/admin/orders` → open order → change status pending→paid→shipped.
4. My Garage flow  
   - Signed-in user saves vehicle → switches default → verifies catalog filter uses selection.
5. Wishlist flow  
   - Add product to wishlist → view `/account/wishlist` → remove product.
6. Address book + checkout  
   - Create shipping address → mark default → verify checkout pre-fills.

Each scenario will become a Playwright spec under `e2e/` with common setup (seed user, env flags).  Sprint exit criterion: all specs green locally + documented in `/docs/e2e-report-2025-12-08.md`.
