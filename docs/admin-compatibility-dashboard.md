# Admin Coverage Dashboard UX (T-16.1)

## Key widgets
1. Totals card (vehicles, with fitment %, with oil %)
2. Brand gap table (top brands missing coverage)
3. Category gap chart (bar chart per category)
4. Filter pills (brand, category, fuel type)
5. Export button (CSV)

## Layout
- Use existing admin sidebar/header; main content grid with cards at top, tables/charts below.
- Keep MVP simple: cards + tables (no complex charts yet).
